# Diana Reyes â€“ Healthcare Data Portfolio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Diana Reyes, and this portfolio is part of my journey into data coordination. I come from a healthcare administration background and built this project to explore how data can improve patient outcomes in a healthcare setting.

*Project Summary
This project is a mock scenario using patient visit data to:
- Track patient retention and drop-off reasons
- Monitor changes in insurance status
- Visualize monthly trends for reporting

*Skills Demonstrated
- Excel-based data organization & cleanup
- SQL: creating tables, importing data, writing queries, and grouping
- Visualizing data through bar, pie, and line charts
- Clear documentation and explanation of workflow

*Whatâ€™s Inside
- `sql/`: Table schema, import steps, and queries
- `excel/`: Patient tracker with cleaned dataset
- `charts/`: Visual reports for analysis and presentations



*This is a learning-based project built with the intention to grow into a Data Coordinator role.* Thanks for checking it out!
